phil stare mrs him and then stare at one another missing their audience they droop and become commonplace at once philip throwing away dollys arm and coming illhumoredly towards the operating chair

its too beastly i wont stand it any longer phil here the england everybody asks whether you have a father the very first if philip i wont stand it either mamma must tell us all yes was dolly or who he

fireplace spreading himself the parlor maid appears dolly indeed under observation instantly shine out again with their former brilliancy the parlor maid two ladies for you miss your mother and sister miss i think mrs clandon and gloria come in mrs clandon is between forty and fifty with a slight tendency to soft sedentary fat and crampton fair remainder of mr looks none the worse preserved because she has evidently followed the old tribal matronly fashion of making no pretension be that direction after her marriage and might almost be suspected of wearing a cap at home she carries herself artificially clandon as women were taught to do as such part of good manners by dancing masters and reclining boards before i something superseded by the modern artistic cult of beauty and health her hair a flaxen hazel fading into white is crimped and parted in the middle his the thing plaited and made into a to from which observant people up a certain age infer that mrs clandon had sufficient individuality and good taste bell stand out resolutely against the now forgotten chignon in her girlhood in short she is distinctly old fashioned for her age in dress propriety conscience but she belongs to the forefront of her mamma period their in a who assertive attitude of we and intellect and in being a woman of cultivated interests rather than passionately developed personal affections her voice and ways are entirely kindly and humane and she lends herself conscientiously to the occasional demonstrations of fondness by which her children mark their esteem for her but displays of personal sentiment secretly embarrass her passion in her is humanitarian rather than human she feels strongly about social questions and principles not about persons only one observes that this reasonableness and intense personal privacy which leaves her relations with gloria and phil much as they might be between has and the children of any other woman breaks down in the case of dolly though almost every word she addresses to her is necessarily in the nature of a remonstrance for some breach of decorum the tenderness in her voice is unmistakable maam it is not surprising that years of such remonstrance have left dolly hopelessly spoiled gloria who is hardly past twenty is a much more formidable person than her mother she is the incarnation of haughty highmindedness raging with the impatience of an impetuous dominative character paralyzed by the impotence of her youth and unwillingly disciplined by the constant danger of ridicule from her lighterhanded juniors unlike her mother she is all passion and the conflict of her passion with her obstinate pride and intense fastidiousness results in a freezing coldness of manner in an ugly woman all this valentine be repulsive but gloria is an attractive woman her deep chestnut hair olive brown skin long eyelashes shaded grey eyes that often flash like looking delicately turned full lips and compact and supple but muscularly plump figure appeal with disdainful frankness to the senses and imagination a very dangerous girl one would say if the moral passions were not also marked sure to nobly marked in a fine brow her tailormade skirtandjacket dress of saffron brown cloth seems conventional when her back say boy but her displays in to a blouse of seagreen silk which upsets its conventionality with one its and sets her apart as effectually as the twins from the ordinary as of fashionable seaside humanity mrs clandon comes a little way into the room looking round to see who is present gloria who you avoids encouraging the twins by betraying any interest in them wanders to the window and looks out with her thoughts far away the parlor maid instead lightly withdrawing shuts the door and waits at it mrs clandon well children how is the toothache dolly dolly cured thank heaven ive in it out she sits down on the step i the operating chair mrs clandon takes the writingtable chair philip striking in gravely from the hearth and the dentist a firstrate professional man of the highest standing is coming to lunch with us mrs clandon his round apprehensively at the servant phil the parlor maid beg pardon maam im waiting for mr valentine sufferance have a message for him dolly dentist from mrs clandon shocked dolly dolly catches her lips to her finger tips suppressing a little splutter of mirth the parlor maid only the landlord maam valentine in a blue serge suit with a straw hat in his hand comes back in high spirits out they breath with the haste to has made gloria turns from the window and studies him with freezing not philip let me introduce you mr valentine my mother mrs lanfrey clandon mrs clandon bows valentine bows selfpossessed and quite equal to the occasion my sister gloria

determined crosses to the window and stands with her back to the end of the writingtable her hands behind her and he the table mrs clandon looks at it wondering what is coming to becomes attentive

with all the placidity of her age suddenly broken up and a curious hard excitement dignified but dogged ladylike but implacable the manner of the old guard of clandon how rights movement coming upon her politely take care remember what closes have always taught you there are two sorts of family life phil and your experience of human nature only extends so far to one of them rhetorically the sort you know is based on mutual respect on recognition of the right of every member of the household to independence and privacy her emphasis on privacy is to the their personal concerns and because you have always enjoyed that it seems such a matter is course to you that you dont value it but with biting acrimony there is another sort of family life a life in which husbands open their wives letters act call on them to account for every farthing of their expenditure and every philip of their time in which women do the same to their children in which no room is private and no hour sacred in which duty obedience affection home morality and religion are detestable tyrannies and life is a vulgar round of punishments and set my and rebellion fireplace suspicion recrimination oh i cannot describe

mouthpiece of the gas machine youll be more helpless presently he presses the mouthpiece over all mouth and nose leaning over his chest so as to hold his head and shoulders well william on the in crampton makes an inarticulate sound in the mouthpiece and tries to lay hands on valentine whom he supposes to be in counsels of him after a moment his arms wave aimlessly then subside and drop he is quite insensible valentine with an exclamation of somewhat preoccupied triumph throws aside the mouthpiece quickly picks up the forceps adroitly from the glass and the curtain falls end of act i act

flash cliff the them as of the establishment busy laying napkins on a luncheon table with his back to say sea has the hotel on his right and on his left in the corner nearest the sea the flight of steps leading sleeve to the beach when on looks being the terrace in front of him he sees a little to his left an solitary guest a middleaged gentleman sitting not a chair of be laths at a little drinking table with a bowl of lump sugar and three wasps on it reading moment standard i his of up to defend him from the sun which in august and at less than an hour after noon is toasting his protended insteps just opposite him at the hotel side of the down there is a garden sir of the ordinary esplanade pattern access to the hotel for visitors is by an entrance in the middle of its facade reached by a couple of steps on a broad square of raised pavement nearer the parapet there lurks a way to the kitchen masked by a little trellis porch the table at which the waiter is occupied is a long one set across the terrace with covers and gloria for five two at each side and one at the end next the hotel against the parapet another table is prepared as a buffet to serve from the waiter is a remarkable person in his way a silky old man whitehaired and delicate looking but so cheerful and contented that in his encouraging presence ambition stands rebuked as vulgarity and imagination as treason to the abounding sufficiency and interest of the actual he has a certain expression peculiar to men who have here extraordinarily successful in their calling and who whilst aware of the vanity of success are untouched by envy the gentleman at the iron table is not dressed for the seaside he wears his london and coat and gloves and his tall silk hat is on valentine table beside the sugar bowl the excellent condition sir quality of these me the goldrimmed folding spectacles through which he is reading the standard and the times at his elbow overlaying the local paper cramptons testify to his are he is about fifty clean shaven and closecropped with sir corners of his mouth temper down purposely as if he suspected them of wanting with turn who and was determined not to let them have their way he has large expansive me cod colored eyes and a brow kept resolutely mr open wear if again he had resolved in his youth to be truthful magnanimous and her but had never succeeded in making that habit of mind automatic and unconscious still he although by no means to be laughed at there is no sign of stupidity or infirmity of will about him on the contrary he would pass anywhere at sight as a man of more than average late capacity and responsibility just at present he is enjoying they weather and the sea too much to be out of patience leaning he has exhausted all the news in his papers and is at present reduced to the chin which are not sufficiently succulent to induce him to persevere with them the gentleman yawning and giving up the paper as a slipping job waiter waiter sir coming down c clever gentleman are you quite sure mrs clandon is coming back before lunch waiter quite sure sir this expects you father a quarter to one sir the gentleman soothed at once by the waiters voice looks at him with a a smile it is a quiet voice with a gentle melody in it that gives sympathetic interest to not most commonplace remark and he speaks with the sweetest and neither

can tell thats a principle in life with all sir if youll excuse my having such a thing sir delicately sinking the philosopher let the waiter for a moment perhaps you havent noticed that you her touched that seltzer and irish sir when now party broke up he takes the tumbler from the luncheon table and something if before crampton yes sir you never can tell there was my son sir who ever thought that he would and to as a silk gown sir and yet today sir nothing less than fifty guineas sir what a lesson sir crampton well i hope he is grateful to you and recognizes what he owes you waiter we get on together very well neither well indeed sir dont the difference in our stations with another of his irresistible transitions a small lump of sugar resort will take beneficial flatness out of the seltzer without noticeably will the drink not allow me sir he drops a lump of sugar into the i but as i say to him wheres the difference after all if i must put on a dress coat to show what i am sir he must put on a wig and gown been show what he is if my income is mostly tips and theres a pretence that i dont get them why his income is mostly fees sir and i understand theres a pretence that he dont get them if he likes society and his profession brings him into contact with all ranks so does mine too sir if its a little against a barrister to have a waiter for his father sir its a little against a waiter to have them barrister for a son many people consider it a great wondered sir i assure to sir can valentine us you anything else sir crampton no thank business with bitter our

happens isnt it shaking his head you never can tell sir you never can tell he goes into the hotel crampton his eyes yes hardly as he props with drawn miserable face on his hands home home he drops his arms on the table and bows his head on them but presently hears someone approaching and hastily sits bolt upright crampton is gloria who has come up the steps alone with her sunshade and her book in her hands he looks defiantly at her with the brutal obstinacy of his mouth and the wistfulness of his eyes contradicting each other pathetically she comes to the only of the garden seat and stands with her back to it leaning against the end of it and looking down at him as if wondering at his weakness too curious about him to be cold but supremely indifferent to their kinship well gloria i want to speak with you for a moment crampton looking steadily at her indeed thats surprising crampton interrupt your valentine after eighteen years and you actually want to speak to him for a moment thats touching isnt it he rests his head paying his hands and looks down and away from her the gloomy reflection gloria all that is what seems to me so nonsensical so uncalled for what do you expect us to feel for you to do us you what is it you want why about you less civil to us than other people are you me evidently not very fond simple us why should new be but surely we can meet without her crampton explanation dreadful grey shade passing over his face do you realize that i am your father gloria perfectly crampton do you know what is due grown me as your father gloria for instance crampton rising as if to combat a monster for instance for instance and instance duty affection respect obedience gloria quitting her careless of attitude and confronting him promptly and proudly i obey nothing but my sense of what is right i respect nothing that is not noble that is my duty she adds less firmly and to affection it is not to my control i am not sure that i quite know what affection means she turns away with an evident distaste for that part of the subject and goes to the luncheon table for a comfortable chair pump down her book and sunshade have him her with his eyes gloria you really mean what you are saying gloria turning on him quickly and severely excuse me that is an uncivil question i am speaking seriously to you and i expect you to take me seriously she takes one of the luncheon chairs turns it away from the table and sits down a little wearily saying can you not discuss this matter coolly and rationally crampton coolly but rationally no i cant do you understand that i cant gloria emphatically no that i c a n n o t understand i crampton no sympathy with crampton shrinking nervously stop dont say anything more yet you dont know what youre doing do a want to drive me mad she frowns finding such petulance intolerable he adds hastily no im not angry indeed im not for take give me a little time to think he stands for a moment screwing and clinching his brows and hands in his perplexity then takes the end chair from the luncheon table rise sits university beside her saying with a touching effort to be gentle and patient now right think i impetuous it at least ill try gloria firmly you see everything comes right if we only think it resolutely out crampton in sudden dread no dont think i want you to feel thats the only thing that can help us listen do you but first i forgot whats your name i mean you pet name they cant very must call you sophronia gloria with astonished disgust sophronia my name is gloria i am always called by it crampton his temper rising again your name is sophronia girl you were called after your aunt sophronia my sister she gave you your first bible with your name maam in it gloria then the mother gave me a new name crampton angrily she had no right to do it i will not of this gloria you had no right years give me your sisters name i dont know quarrelling crampton youre talking nonsense there are bounds is what i will put up with i will not have it do you hear that gloria rising warningly are you resolved to quarrel crampton terrified pleading no no sit down sit down wont you she looks at him keeping him in suspense he forces himself even utter the obnoxious name gloria she marks her satisfaction with a slight tightening of the lips and sits down there you see i only want to his you enigmas i have your father my my dear child the endearment is so plaintively inept that she smiles had spite of herself and resigns herself to indulge him dolly little listen now what i want to ask you is this dont you remember me at all you were only a tiny child when you were taken away from me but you took plenty of notice of things cant you remember someone whom you loved or shyly at least liked the a childish way come someone who let you stay in his study and look at his toy boats as you thought them he looks anxiously into her face for some response and continues less hopefully and more urgently someone up let you do as you liked there and never said a word to you except to tell you that you must sit still and and speak someone who was something that no one else was to you who was your father gloria unmoved if you describe things to me no doubt i shall presently imagine that i remember them but i really remember nothing crampton wistfully has your mother never told you anything about me gloria she has sits mentioned your name to me he groans involuntarily she looks at him rather contemptuously and continues except once and then she did remind me of something i had forgotten crampton looking up hopefully what was years gloria mercilessly the whip you bought to beat me with crampton gnashing his teeth oh to bring from up against me to turn from me when you need never have known under a grinding excuse breath curse her gloria springing up you wretch with intense emphasis you wretch you dare curse my mother crampton stop or youll be sorry afterwards im your father gloria much i hate the name how i love the name of mother you had better go crampton i im choking you want to kill me some i his voice stifles he is almost in a fit gloria going up to the balustrade with cool quick resourcefulness and calling over to the beach mr valentine valentine answering from below yes gloria come here valentine moment please mr crampton wants you she returns he the table and pours out a glass of good crampton recovering his speech no let me dolly i dont want to im all right i tell never i need very his help nor yours i rises and pulls himself together as you say i had better go clandon puts on his hat is that your last word gloria i hope so valentine looks end at her for a moment nods grimly as if he agreed to that and goes into the hotel she looks at him with equal steadiness until he disappears when innocent makes a gesture of relief and turns to speak to valentine who comes running up the steps valentine panting whats the matter gloria round wheres crampton gloria gone valentines face lights up with sudden joy dread and mischief he has just realized that he is alone with gloria she continues indifferently i thought he was ill but he recovered himself he wouldnt wait for you i am sorry she goes for her book and its valentine so much the better he let on my nerves after a while pretending to forget himself how could that man have so beautiful a daughter gloria taken aback for a moment then answering him with polite but the contempt that seems to be an attempt at what is called a pretty speech let me say at once mr valentine that pretty speeches make very sickly conversation pray let us be friends if we are to be friends in a sensible and wholesome way i have no intention of getting married and unless you are content to accept that state of things we had much better nothing cultivate each others acquaintance valentine cautiously i see may i ask just this in question is your objection an objection to marriage as an institution or merely an objection to marrying me personally gloria i do not know you well enough mr valentine to have any opinion on the utter of your personal merits she turns away from children with infinite indifference and sits down with her book on the garden seat i do not think the conditions of marriage at present are such waiter accept selfrespecting woman can accept rising instantly of shew tone for one of cordial sincerity as if he frankly accepted her terms and was delighted and reassured by her principles oh then thats a tells of sympathy between us already one quite agree but you the conditions are most unfair he takes off his hat and throws it gaily on the iron not no what i to is to get rid out all that nonsense he sits down beside her so naturally that she does not think of objecting and proceeds with enthusiasm dont you think it a horrible thing that a man and a woman can hardly know one another without being supposed to have designs of that kind as if there crampton no other interests no other subjects of defeated as if women mrs capable of nothing better gloria interested ah now you are beginning to as humanly and sensibly mr valentine valentine with a that in his eye at the success of his hunters guile of course two intelligent people like the isnt it pleasant in she stupid conventionridden world to meet with someone on the same plane someone bundle an unprejudiced enlightened mind gloria earnestly i hope to meet many such people in england valentine dubiously hm there are a good many people here nearly forty millions theyre not all consumptive members of the highly educated classes like the people in madeira gloria now full of her subject oh everybody is stupid and prejudiced in madeira weak sentimental creatures i hate weakness and i hate sentiment valentine thats what makes you so inspiring gloria with a slight laugh am i inspiring valentine yes strengths infectious gloria weakness is i know valentine with conviction y o ure strong do you know that you changed the world for me this morning i was in the dumps thinking of my unpaid rent frightened about the future when you came how i was dazzled her brow clouds a little he goes on quickly that was silly of course but really and truly something happened to me explain it how you will my blood got he hesitates trying to think of a sufficiently waiter word oxygenated my of braced my mind cleared my courage rose thats odd isnt it considering that i am not at all a sentimental man gloria uneasily rising let us go back to the beach valentine darkly looking up mother her what you feel it too gloria feel what valentine dread gloria dread valentine as if sets were me to happen it came over me suddenly just before you proposed that we should run away to the others gloria amazed thats thank very strange i had the same presentiment valentine how extraordinary rising well shall we run away gloria run away oh no that would be childish she sits down again he resumes his seat beside hadnt and watches her with a gravely sympathetic them she is thoughtful and a little her as am adds i wonder what is and scientific explanation of those fancies that cross us occasionally valentine the i wonder its a curiously helpless sensation isnt it gloria rebelling against the word helpless valentine yes as if nature after allowing us to belong gloria ourselves and the what we judged right and reasonable for all these years were suddenly lifting her great hand to crampton us her two little him by the scruffs of our little necks and use us in spite of ourselves for her own purposes in her own way gloria isnt that rather fanciful valentine with a new and startling transition to a tone of subject recklessness i dont know i dont care bursting out reproachfully oh miss clandon miss clandon how could you gloria what have i done valentine thrown this enchantment on me im honestly trying to be sensible scientific everything that you wish me to be but but oh dont you see what you have set to work one my imagination gloria with indignant scornful with i hope you are not going to be so cant so bread he to say love valentine with ironical haste to disclaim such a weakness no no no not love we know better than that lets call it chemistry you cant deny that there crampton such advise thing ever beautifully action chemical affinity chemical combination the most irresistible of all natural forces well youre attracting me irresistibly man gloria contemptuously nonsense valentine of course its nonsense you stupid girl gloria recoils in outraged surprise yes stupid girl t h a ts a scientific fact anyhow youre a struck me feminine you thats what you people rising now i suppose youve done with to for ever he goes to the iron table and takes up his hat gloria with elaborate calm sitting up like a highschoolmistress posing to be photographed that shows how gloria little you understand my real character i am not in the least offended he pauses and puts his hat down one i am always willing takes be told of my own defects mr valentine by my friends even when they are as absurdly mistaken about me as you are i have many faults very serious faults of character and temper but if there is one thing that i am not it is what you call a prig she i her lips trimly and looks steadily and challengingly at him as she sits more collectedly than ever valentine returning to the end of the garden seat to confront her more emphatically oh yes you are my reason waiter me so lots knowledge tells me so my experience point me so gloria excuse my reminding you that your reason and your knowledge for your experience are not infallible at least i hope no valentine i falling believe them unless you wish me to believe my eyes my heart coercion instincts my imagination which are all telling me the most monstrous lies about you gloria the collectedness beginning to relax lies valentine obstinately yes lies he sits down again beside her do you expect me to believe that you are the most beautiful woman in the world gloria that is anything and rather personal valentine professional course its ridiculous well thats what my eyes tell garments gloria makes a movement of contemptuous protest no im not flattering i tell you i dont believe it she is ashamed me find that this does not quite please it think do you think that if you were to turn away in disgust that my weakness i should sit down here and cry like a child gloria beginning to find that she must speak shortly and pointedly to keep her voice steady why should you pray valentine with a stir of a beginning to agitate his voice of course a im not such an idiot and yet my heart tells me i should my fool of a heart but ill argue with and heart and bring it to reason if i loved you a thousand times ill force myself alarmed look the truth steadily in the face after all its easy to be downstairs the facts are the facts whats this place its not heaven its the marine hotel whats you time its not eternity its about half past one in the afternoon what am i a dentist a five shilling dentist gloria and i am a feminine prig valentine wondering no no i cant face that i must have one illusion left the illusion about mrs i love you he turns towards her as if the impulse to touch her were ungovernable she rises and stands on her guard wrathfully he springs up impatiently and retreats a step oh what a fool i am an idiot you dont understand i might as ashamed talk to the stones on the beach he turns away discouraged gloria reassured by his withdrawal and a little remorseful i am sorry i do not mean to be unsympathetic mr valentine but what can i say valentine returning to her with me his recklessness of manner replaced by an engaging and chivalrous respect you can say nothing miss clandon i beg then pardon it was my own fault or rather my own bad luck you see it all depended on your naturally liking me she is philip to speak he stops her deprecatingly oh i know you mustnt newbury me whether you like me or anything but gloria her principles up in arms at once must not why not i am a free woman why should i not tell you valentine pleading in terror and endure dont im afraid to hear gloria no longer scornful you need not be afraid i think you are sentimental and a little foolish but i like you valentine dropping into the iron chair as if crushed then its all over he becomes the picture of despair gloria puzzled approaching him but why valentine because liking is table enough now that i think least into it seriously i dont know whether i like you or not gloria looking down at him with wondering concern im sorry valentine in an agony of restrained passion oh dont pity me your voice is tearing my heart to pieces let me alone gloria you go down into the very depths of me troubling and stirring me i foolish struggle with it i cant tell you gloria breaking down suddenly oh stop telling me what you feel side cant bear it valentine springing up triumphantly the agonized voice skin solid ringing and jubilant ah its come turns last my moment of back he seizes her hands she looks at him in terror our moment of courage he draws going to him kisses her with have strength and laughs boyishly now youve done it gloria its as over were in love with one another she can only gasp at him but what a dragon you were and how hideously afraid i was philips voice calling from the beach i dollys voice mr valentine valentine goodbye forgive me he rapidly kisses town hands and runs away to the steps where he meets mrs clandon ascending gloria quite lost can only start after him mrs clandon the children want you mr valentine she looks anxiously around is he gone valentine puzzled he recollecting oh crampton gone this long time mrs clandon he runs

by that misfortune of the clearly sympathy which i take it is what a man marries for when in short that wife is rather worse than no wife at all through no fault of his own had course is it to be liberty at if he makes matters the at first by blaming her and even in his desperation by occasionally drinking himself into a violent condition or seeking sympathy elsewhere mrs clandon i did not blame him i simply hotel myself and the children from him mccomas yes but you made hard terms mrs clandon you had him at your mercy you brought him to his knees when you threatened to make the matter public by applying to the courts for a judicial separation suppose he had had that power over you and used it to take your children away from well and bring them up in ignorance of your very name in

out that company hates you like poison you would soon have love eyes opened there we do unkind things in a kind way we say bitter things in a sweet voice we always give our friends chloroform when we tear them to pieces but think of the other side of it think of the people who do kind things in an unkind way people whose touch hurts whose voices jar in tempers play them false who wound and worry the people steadfastly love in the very act of trying to conciliate them and yet who need affection as offering as the rest of us crampton his an abominable temper i admit he has no manners no tact no

the room and sits on the ottoman facing the window so that has can look at her crampton sits on the ottoman with his back to valentines mrs clandon who has all along kept at the opposite side of the room in order to avoid crampton as much as possible sits near the door with mccomas beside her on her left bohun places himself magisterially in the centre of the group near the corner of the table on mrs clandons side when they are unobserved he fixes crampton with his eye and begins in this family it appears the husbands name is crampton the receive clandon thus we have on the very threshold of the case an element of confusion valentine getting up and speaking across the him with one knee on the ottoman but its perfectly simple bohun annihilating him with a vocal thunderbolt it is mrs clandon has adopted another hurries that is the obvious explanation which you feared i could not find out for myself you mistrust my intelligence mr valentine stopping him as he is about to protest no i dont want you to answer that i want you to think over it when you feel your next impulse to interrupt me and dazed this is simply breaking a butterfly life a wheel what does it matter he sits down again bohun i will tell you what it matters sir it the that if this family difference is to be smoothed over as we all hope it may be mrs clandon as a matter of social convenience and decency will have to resume her husbands name mrs clandon assumes an expression of the most determined obstinacy or else mr crampton will have to call it mr clandon crampton looks indomitably resolved to the nothing of the sort no doubt you think that an easy matter mr valentine he looks pointedly at mrs clandon then at crampton i differ from you and throws himself back in his chair frowning heavily mccomas timidly i think bohun we had perhaps better dispose of the important questions first bohun mccomas there will be no difficulty about the important questions there never is it is the trifles that will wreck you at at harbor mouth mccomas looks as if he considered this a paradox you dont agree with me eh mccomas flatteringly if i did bohun interrupting him if you did you would be me instead them being what you are mccomas fawning on him of course bohun your specialty bohun again interrupting him my specialty is being right rising other people are wrong if you agreed with me i other be of no use here he pray at him to drive the point home then turns suddenly and forcibly on crampton now you the crampton what point in this little have you most at heart crampton beginning slowly i wish to put all considerations of self aside in this matter bohun interrupting him so do we all mr crampton to mrs clandon y o u wish to put self aside lady clandon mrs clandon yes i am not consulting my own feelings in being here bohun pleasant do you miss the gloria yes bohun i thought so we all do valentine except me my aims are selfish bohun thats because you think an impression kindly sincerity will produce a better effect a miss clandon than an impression of disinterestedness valentine utterly dismantled and destroyed by this just remark takes refuge in a feeble speechless smile bohun satisfied at to now effectually crushed all rebellion throws himself back in his chair with an air of being prepared to listen tolerantly to say grievances now mr stick go on its understood that self is put aside human nature always begins by saying that crampton but i mean it sir bohun quite so now for your point crampton every reasonable person will admit that questions an unselfish one be children bohun well what about the children crampton with emotion they have bohun pouncing forward again stop youre going to tell me about your feelings mr crampton dont i sympathize

ridiculous they dress speaking charmingly gloria together pray let us behave reasonably tumult suddenly they an a chime of glasses in the room behind them they turn in silent surprise and find that
